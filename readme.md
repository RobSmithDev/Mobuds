# Mobuds (formerly TalkEasi): The Original Bluetooth Mesh Chat App – Before Smartphones Took Over

![Mobuds Logo](/minilogo1.gif)

Back in **2006**, before the rise of iPhones and Androids, I created **Mobuds**, a pioneering mobile app built in **Java J2ME**. Designed for chatting — and yes, dating too — it worked on early mobile phones long before the app ecosystem we take for granted existed.

## 🌐 What Was Mobuds?

Mobuds enabled a **Bluetooth-based mesh network** between nearby devices. Phones running the app could:

- Connect directly to others nearby
- Estimate proximity based on the number of Bluetooth “hops”
- Share messages and user-profiles across the mesh — **without the internet**
- Creating a **hyper-local social network**, syncing with a website to find matches and build connections later on.

Each user had a basic profile (nickname, age, gender) that could be discovered and shared across the mesh network.

## 📡 The Mo-Hub Concept

To expand its reach, I designed the concept of a **“mo-hub”** — a fixed Bluetooth node that could:

- Act as a central relay to extend mesh range
- Connect venues together (extending the mesh)
- Serve localized ads to nearby devices (potential monetization)

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

Mobuds tackled the limitations of early mobile platforms with some clever solutions:

- Built in **Java J2ME**
- Worked on pre-smartphone devices
- Used **Bluetooth service descriptions** to passively broadcast messages even when direct connections weren’t possible
- Included:
  - ✅ Friends list  
  - 🚫 Block list  
  - 🔔 Proximity alerts (get notified when someone matching criteria is nearby)

This was essential in an era where:

- Internet data was **expensive**
- GPS was **rare**
- Bluetooth support was **inconsistent**

## 🧠 Innovation Ahead of Its Time

Although a patent was drafted and submitted (2007) for the core technology, it wasn’t completed due to cost. However, this work exists as **prior art**, protecting it from being re-patented.

> _A draft of the patent application is included in this repository for reference (UK Application 0717040.0, Publication GB2455964. The other name of the Patent was in charge of graphic/website design) ._

## 🚀 Legacy and Open Release

This was my **first Java project** — and a steep learning curve. When smartphones arrived, I didn’t have the resources to port Mobuds to iOS or Android.

Still, I’m proud of what it achieved:  
> A fully offline, peer-to-peer Bluetooth chat and discovery network — before the world was ready.

## 🔓 Free to Use

I’m releasing this code as a reference for anyone interested in:

- Offline communication
- Bluetooth mesh networks
- Early mobile application architecture
- Peer-to-peer discovery

> ⚠️ If someone claims they invented Bluetooth Mesh Messaging after 2006 — remind them:  
> **Mobuds got there first.** (check the domain name registration date!)
